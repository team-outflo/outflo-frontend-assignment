# OutFlo - Campaign Interview Repository

Welcome! This repository has been specifically prepared for the campaign-focused frontend assignment.

## Repository Scope

This version of the codebase has been intentionally minimized to focus ONLY on campaign-related features. To protect our IP, many other product areas have been removed:

- **Available Features:** Login, Signup, All Campaigns list, Campaign Editor (View/Edit), and Campaign Analytics.

## Guidelines for Candidates

- **Focus Area:** Your task will involve working within the campaign-related pages (`src/pages/CampaignsList.tsx`, `src/pages/CampaignEditorPage.tsx`, etc.).
- **Environment:** Use the existing authentication flow (Login/Signup) to access the application.
- **Do Not Rebuild:** Please do not attempt to rebuild any of the removed product areas.
- **File Paths:** Do not change file paths for campaign-related files, but you can create new folder or files if it required.

## Build and Run

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start development server: `npm run dev`
3. Build for production: `npm run build`

Happy coding!
