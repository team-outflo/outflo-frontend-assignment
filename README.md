# OutFlo - Campaign Frontend Assignment

Welcome to the OutFlo frontend assignment! This repository has been specifically prepared for your interview, focusing on our campaign-related features.

## Repository Overview

This version of the codebase has been intentionally minimized to focus ONLY on campaign-related features. Other product areas have been removed to keep the scope clear:

- **Available Features:** Login, Signup, All Campaigns List, Campaign Editor (View/Edit), and Campaign Analytics.
- **Technologies:** Vite, TypeScript, React, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start Development Server:**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Build for Production:**
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

## Guidelines for Candidates

- **Focus Area:** Your task will primarily involve working within the campaign-related pages (`src/pages/CampaignsList.tsx`, `src/pages/CampaignEditorPage.tsx`, etc.).
- **Environment:** Use the existing authentication flow (Login/Signup) to access the application.
- **Code Structure:** Do not change file paths for existing campaign-related files. However, feel free to create new folders or files as needed for your implementation.
- **Constraints:** Please do not attempt to rebuild any of the removed product areas.

## What we look for

- Clean, maintainable, and well-typed TypeScript code.
- Proper use of React hooks and state management patterns.
- Attention to detail in UI/UX using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui.
- clear commits and documentation of your thought process.

Happy coding!
